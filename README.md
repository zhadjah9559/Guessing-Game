# Guessing-Game



This program will ask the user to guess a number from one to one hundred. When the user guesses wrong, the program will tell the user that the guessed number is between a certain set of values 
ie:

guess  :  11
program: "Incorrect, guess is in between  31 and 40"

From this point, the user will have to guess the correct int the program generated. The program will then let the user know if the number is higher or lower.

Final steps:
-Handle exceptions in terms of input mistach
-if number generated is 21, and user picks all numbers from 11 - 20, the program will not accept the correct answer when the user finaly picks 21
  >Modify for loop for how many guesses can be guessed in order to work around this problem
